# blox [![Built on Blockly](https://tinyurl.com/built-on-blockly)](https://github.com/google/blockly)

This project uses two Blockly componenets to create an html editor (for the UI) and a block based code editor alongside. Below is the resulting code and onthe right side is the blox project.

This project evolved out of running a Kids Coding class using Scratch.

The blocks are stored in a MySQL database. The resulting code can be uploaded as a runnable project.  The sample RPN calculator is here: tba

Work in progress!
