# blox [![Built on Blockly](https://tinyurl.com/built-on-blockly)](https://github.com/google/blockly)

This project uses two Blockly componenets to create an html editor (for the UI) and a block based code editor with som extensions to allow pure javascript. Below is the resulting code and on the right side is a sample blox project (a RPN calculator).

This project evolved out of running a Kids Coding class using Scratch.

The blocks are stored in a MySQL database. The resulting code can be uploaded as a runnable project.  Developing a sample RPN calculator is shown below.
